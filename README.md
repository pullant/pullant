Looking to work with people who are:
-	**Customer oriented**. Yes "customer", even if the code produced is not always in exchange for money, treat users as if they gave you their hard-earned money.
-	**Open**. To share their knowledge, to take feedback, to find fun solutions.
-	**Code first**. Let's do some programming.
